# any-shape

### Tools for less boilerplate, more flow.

Hey! I’m the creator behind `any-shape` — a home for open-source tools, modules, and ideas built to automate the boring stuff and let developers focus on what truly matters.

## 🧩 What I Build

- ⚙️ **Vue/Nuxt modules**
- 🧰 **CLI tools for speeding up workflows**
- 🔄 **SQL/Node snippets for data, system, and process automation**
- 💡 **Gists and dev tips to cut through routine and friction**

## 🛠️ All my tools are:
- **Fully open-source**
- **Type-safe and scalable**
- **Designed for devs who want to focus on what matters**

## 🧭 Why I Do It

I believe developer tools should feel effortless and invisible. Every module, snippet, or CLI I share comes from real pain points I’ve solved in my own work — if it saves me hours, it might save you even more.
